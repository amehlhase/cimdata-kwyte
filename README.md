## About
This project is a responsive one-pager I created within 3 days during a coding bootcamp. The advertised product is a fictional meditation app called „kwyte“.

## Technology
I used HTML and CSS/Sass to create this responsive website. To have a look you can visit https://kwyte-cimdata.vercel.app/ or download the code and just open the index file in your browser, there is no special setup needed here.

## State
This project is finished and will not be updated.
